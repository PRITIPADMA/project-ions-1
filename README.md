## Bringing  solar  and  hydro energy into  use

**Solar energy** has become much more accessible and affordable, making it extremely competitive to oil and gas. Prices have dropped significantly in previous years, allowing consumers to see a greater return on investment for solar energy. This opens up doors for individuals, private businesses and public utilities alike to seek long-term solar options. Unlike more popular choices, like rooftop and ground mounted solar, floating PV is quickly catching on as a third alternative to traditional solar especially amongst resource intensive industries.

## Ideation of the model
**Foldable Solar Panel** for sustainable solar energy consumption.
**Square plated** water harvesting system.
